  <section>
    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>Doug architected the Sarasota County Property Appraiser public website between 2010–2014. His design leveraged .NET and Umbraco to deliver public search interfaces still in use today. At <strong>Gooee</strong> (2017–2018), he helped build IoT dashboard components in Angular, integrating with real-time telemetry for smart lighting. At <strong>Nextech Systems</strong> (2018–2022), he engineered an in-house OIDC authentication system, advised the CTO, and revamped Angular performance. He also contributed to the Whitehat Security team and established system-wide documentation workflows.</p>
    <p>Earlier at <strong>Gentiva Health Services</strong> (2008–2010), he developed ETL pipelines and OCR cleanup tools for patient outcome analysis, having been promoted from temp role to full analyst due to performance.</p>

    <h2>OpenSea & Creative Protocols</h2>
    <p>Under <a href="https://opensea.io/goatshed_digital" target="_blank">goatshed_digital</a>, Doug minted and published a collection of original NFTs built around digitally verifiable proof-of-concept systems. This includes the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/draw-something" target="_blank">Draw Something</a> series—124 unique doodles turned into protocol artifacts. These collections demonstrate ratification and ownership linking, echoing Doug’s blockchain-inspired work on document registration and proof-of-authorship strategies.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Consulting & GoatShed Digital</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2022, <a href="https://goatshed.digital" target="_blank">GoatShed Digital</a> is Doug’s consultancy and delivery platform. As a consultant, he implemented speech synthesis orchestration integrated with Azure’s Cognitive Services for CenturionCARES, established role-based identity in Kubernetes workloads, and launched an internal prototype for the PDS system—digitally ratifying legislative-like proposals via NFT registries.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Methodology & Technical Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Doug developed the <strong>Salvo Sequence</strong>—a planning methodology that applies layered validation across code, documentation, and business requirements. His model relies on a cycle of derived assumption, test case generation, and iterative feedback—combining Agile, Kanban, and Waterfall into a nonlinear model. He also champions <strong>living documentation</strong>, where every contributor maintains a traceable source-of-truth wiki or PR trail, and <strong>green-check automation</strong>, where infrastructure, logic, and resilience must all pass before merging code.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Mentorship & Team Structure</h2>
    <p>Doug applies a unique mentorship framework: <em>Doctor, Mentor, Proctor, Actor</em>. A Doctor designs systems. A Mentor guides. A Proctor reviews. An Actor executes. Doug often embodies all roles early in a project, then transitions knowledge to teammates. His commitment to structure ensures processes are documented, reusable, and measurable across contributors.</p>
